INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:

The Code is divided into 7 parts because the Tensorflow (GPU) is only able to execute one model at a time in GPU. 
So if we execute one model after the other then the Kernel of Jupyter Restarts due to which all the data is lost.

IMPORTANT: Please, shutdown and close each .ipynb File after execution to reset the Kernel.


(1) First, execute the "Assignment 1 Data Preprocessing and Word Embedding Matrix.ipynb" File, 
which will Preprocess the Data and will save it to the D drive or any other desired location of the Computer.

(2) After this, execute "Assignment 1 Glove.ipynb" File to run the Neural Network Model with Glove Matrix Embedding.

(3) Then, execute "Assignment 1 Google.ipynb" File to run the Neural Network Model with Google Matrix Embedding.

(4) Next, execute "Assignment 1 Paragram.ipynb" File to run the Neural Network Model with Paragram Matrix Embedding.

(5) After this, execute "Assignment 1 Wikipedia.ipynb" File to run the Neural Network Model with Wikipedia Matrix Embedding.

(6) Then, execute "Assignment 1 Average.ipynb" File to run the Neural Network Model with Average Matrix Embedding (which was created in (Assignment 1 Data Preprocessing and Word Embedding Matrix.ipynb)).

(7) Lastly, execute "Assignment 1 Ensemble.ipynb" File to combine (Ensemble) predicted targets generated by the above five Embedding Matrices by averaging then.
